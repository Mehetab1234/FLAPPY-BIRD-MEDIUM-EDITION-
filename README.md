## Flappy Bird Game

## Overview

Flappy Bird is a popular arcade game where the player controls a bird navigating through a series of pipes by tapping to make the bird "flap" and avoid obstacles. The objective is to survive for as long as possible and earn coins that can be used to buy a life when the game is over. The game gets progressively harder as the bird flies further and more pipes spawn.

This version of Flappy Bird has been recreated using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript and can be played directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Endless gameplay**: Keep flying as long as you avoid pipes.
- **Coins**: Collect coins by flying close to the pipes without hitting them.
- **Store**: Use coins to buy an extra life after the game is over (if you have enough coins).
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Sounds**: The game includes sound effects for jumping and game over.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** or download the files directly:
    - You can use [] to run the game instantly.
    - Alternatively, download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and open the HTML file in any modern web browser.

2. **Run the game**:
    - If you're using a local environment, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.
    - The game will automatically adjust to your screen size and start on page load.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Click the "Play" button in the lobby.
2. **Control the bird**: Click or tap anywhere on the screen to make the bird "flap" and avoid the pipes.
3. **Collect coins**: Fly close to the pipes without hitting them to collect coins. These will be displayed in the top left corner.
4. **Game Over**: When the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends. You can restart the game or return to the lobby.
5. **Store**: If you have collected enough coins (at least 10), you can buy an extra life to continue the game after a game over.
